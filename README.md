# A simple toolkit for generating doc with appledoc

## Prerequisition
* You must have the *__appledoc__* installed in your system.

## Install the scripts and setup the Xcode behavior
1. Put xcode-appledoc.osascript and generate-appledoc.sh into somewhere.
2. Open Xcode, create a new behavior, name it "Generate Documents",
   check the "Run", pick the "xcode-appledoc.osascript".
3. (Optional) Set a keybord shortcut for the new behavior.

## How to use
1. Copy the AppledocSettings.plist into your project directory.
2. Modify the AppledocSettings.plist according to the project specified information.
3. In the menu, select "Xcode" -> "Behaviors" -> "Generate Documents"
   to run the "Generate Documents" behavior.
